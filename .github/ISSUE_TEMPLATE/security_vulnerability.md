## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Private Disclosure for Sensitive Vulnerabilities

**If this vulnerability could be exploited in the wild, please DO NOT create a public issue.**

Instead, use one of these private reporting methods:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Report Privately](https://github.com/Dezirae-Stark/QWAMOS/security/advisories/new)
- **Encrypted Email**: qwamos@tutanota.com (PGP key available on request)

Public issues should only be used for:
- General security discussions
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (already publicly disclosed)
- Security enhancements (not exploitable vulnerabilities)

- [ ] Other: _________

## Impact Assessment

**Severity:**
- [ ] Critical - Allows full system compromise
- [ ] High - Allows unauthorized access or data theft
- [ ] Medium - Limited impact, requires specific conditions
- [ ] Low - Minimal security impact

**Attack Complexity:**
- [ ] Low - Easy to exploit, no special conditions required
- [ ] Medium - Requires some user interaction or specific conditions
- [ ] High - Difficult to exploit, requires multiple preconditions

**Affected Versions:**
- QWAMOS Version: [e.g., v1.2.0 and earlier]
- Affected Components: [e.g., VM isolation, crypto module, gateway]

**CIA Triad Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low / [ ] None
- **Integrity**: [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low / [ ] None
- **Availability**: [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low / [ ] None

## Attack Scenario

**Who could exploit this?**
- [ ] Tier 1: Casual attacker (malware, phishing)
- [ ] Tier 2: Sophisticated attacker (targeted malware)
- [ ] Tier 3: Nation-state actor (zero-days, supply chain)
- [ ] Tier 4: Post-quantum adversary
- [ ] Tier 5: Physical access attacker

**Prerequisites for exploitation:**
- Root access required: [Yes / No]
- Network access required: [Yes / No]
- User interaction required: [Yes / No]
- Special hardware required: [Yes / No]

## Steps to Reproduce (If Safe to Disclose)

**⚠️ Only include reproduction steps if they are safe to share publicly**

If the vulnerability is sensitive, skip this section and use private disclosure methods.

```bash
# Example steps (DO NOT include real exploit code)
1. Create VM with: ./scripts/create_vm.sh --name test
2. Configure with: ...
3. Trigger vulnerability by: ...
4. Observe: [behavior that indicates vulnerability]
```

## Environment Information

**Test Environment:**
- Device: [e.g., Pixel 7]
- Android Version: [e.g., Android 14]
- QWAMOS Version: [e.g., v1.2.0]
- VM Mode: [QEMU / KVM / Chroot / PRoot]
- Gateway: [Tor / I2P / DNSCrypt]

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# Relevant configuration that triggers the vulnerability
# Remove sensitive information (passwords, keys, etc.)
```

## Proof of Concept (If Safe to Share)

**⚠️ DO NOT include working exploit code in public issues**

- [ ] I have a proof of concept (will share privately)
- [ ] I have a video demonstration (will share privately)
- [ ] I have not developed a proof of concept

**Observed Behavior:**
Describe what happens when the vulnerability is triggered (without providing exploit details).

## Recommended Mitigation

**Immediate Workarounds:**
List any temporary mitigations users can apply immediately:
1. Disable feature X
2. Apply configuration Y
3. Avoid using Z

**Suggested Fix (High-Level):**
Describe potential fixes without providing exploit details:
- Add input validation in module X
- Enforce stricter isolation in component Y
- Update cryptographic library Z to version W

**Patch Outline (If You Have Ideas):**
```python
# High-level pseudocode (not actual exploit code)
def fix_vulnerability():
    # Add validation
    if input_is_malicious():
        return error

    # Apply fix
    sanitize_input()
    enforce_policy()
```
