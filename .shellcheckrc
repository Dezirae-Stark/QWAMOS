# QWAMOS ShellCheck Configuration
# Shell script static analysis and linting
# https://www.shellcheck.net/

# Specify the shell dialect
# Options: sh, bash, dash, ksh
# Leave unset to auto-detect from shebang
# shell=bash

# Enable optional checks
enable=all

# Disable specific checks
# Format: disable=SC####,SC####

disable=

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Disabled because we often source files with variable paths
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# Disabled for files that may not exist in all environments
disable+=,SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Disabled for variables that may be used in sourced scripts
# Uncomment if this causes too many false positives:
# disable+=,SC2034

# SC2046: Quote to prevent word splitting
# Keep enabled - important for security

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Keep enabled - important for security

# SC2148: Add shebang to the top of your script
# Keep enabled - ensures scripts are properly identified

# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned
# Keep enabled - helps catch typos and missing variable definitions

# Severity levels to include
# Options: error, warning, info, style
# Default: error,warning

# Only show errors and warnings (hide info and style)
# severity=error,warning

# Show all severity levels
severity=error,warning,info,style

# Source path for finding sourced files
# Helps ShellCheck find scripts that are sourced
# source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# External sources (files that are sourced from other projects)
# Format: external-sources=true
external-sources=false

# Enable checking of sourced files
# check-sourced=true

# Color output
# Options: auto, always, never
# color=auto

# Format for output
# Options: checkstyle, diff, gcc, json, json1, quiet, tty
# format=gcc

# Exclude paths (relative to project root)
# Use .shellcheckignore file for more complex exclusions
# exclude-dir=.git
# exclude-dir=node_modules
# exclude-dir=.venv

# Minimum severity to report
# Options: error, warning, info, style
# norc=false

# Wiki link format (for error explanations)
# format: tty will show links in terminal
# wiki-link-count=3

# Additional configuration notes:
#
# 1. For inline disabling of checks, use:
#    # shellcheck disable=SC####
#    command here
#
# 2. For disabling checks for the entire file:
#    # shellcheck disable=SC####
#    (at the top of the file)
#
# 3. To check which shell is being assumed:
#    # shellcheck shell=bash
#
# 4. Common useful checks to keep enabled:
#    - SC2086: Quote variables to prevent word splitting
#    - SC2046: Quote command substitutions
#    - SC2068: Quote array expansions
#    - SC2145: Quote arguments to prevent globbing
#    - SC2155: Declare and assign separately
#
# 5. Security-related checks (always keep enabled):
#    - SC2006: Use $(...) instead of backticks
#    - SC2116: Useless echo?
#    - SC2006: Deprecated syntax
#
# 6. POSIX compliance:
#    Use `# shellcheck shell=sh` for POSIX-compliant scripts
#
# 7. Best practices enabled by default:
#    - Quote expansions to prevent word splitting
#    - Use [[ ]] instead of [ ] in Bash
#    - Prefer ${var} over $var for clarity
#    - Check exit codes of commands
#
# See: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki
# for detailed explanations of all checks
