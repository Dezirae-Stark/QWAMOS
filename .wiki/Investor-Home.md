# QWAMOS Investor Overview

QWAMOS—Qubes+Whonix Advanced Mobile OS—is a next-generation security platform designed as a mobile hypervisor operating system for ARM64 devices. Unlike Android-based security models, QWAMOS controls the hardware directly and isolates every digital activity into hardened virtual machine domains. Android, GrapheneOS, Kali NetHunter, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu run as guest OS VMs on top of the hypervisor layer, each with mandatory access controls, encrypted storage, and independent network paths.

A Whonix-inspired gateway integrates Tor, I2P, DNSCrypt, and layered VPNs, ensuring that each identity, app, and workflow is compartmentalized, anonymous, and unlinkable. QWAMOS employs post-quantum cryptography (Kyber), ChaCha20/Poly1305 encryption, and BLAKE3 hashing, along with sealed audit logs and panic-wipe gestures for coercion-resistant protection.

The result is the first true intelligence-grade, offensive-resilient, mobile hypervisor OS operable on commercial hardware — with applications in national security, enterprise mobility, whistleblower protection, field intelligence, cryptocurrency security, and secure corporate communications.
