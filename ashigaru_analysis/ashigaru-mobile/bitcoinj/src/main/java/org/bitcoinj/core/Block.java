 * <p>A block is a group of transactions, and is one of the fundamental data structures of the Bitcoin system.

 * chain, and proves that a difficult calculation was done over its contents. See
 * <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">the Bitcoin technical paper</a> for
 * more detail on blocks. <p/>

 * specifically using {@link Peer#getBlock(Sha256Hash)}, or grab one from a downloaded {@link BlockChain}.</p>
