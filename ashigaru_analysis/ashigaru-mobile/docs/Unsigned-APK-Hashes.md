# Unsigned APK Hashes

With each officially released Ashigaru mobile APK file, the APK version will be added to the table below along with its unsigned APK hash.

The listed unsigned APK hashes are the result of Ashigaru Open Source Project's own reproducibility testing prior to public release, and should be used by independent third-parties only as an aid to proving reproducibility.

When hashing your own unsigned production APK, and hashing the officially released Ashigaru mobile APK file ([after stripping it of its signatures](VerifyAPK.md)), you may choose to compare the output to the corresponding unsigned APK hash shown in the table to check you are on the correct path. If any of your locally computed unsigned APK hashs outputs yield a differing result, you should troubleshoot your build environment and review your test steps.
