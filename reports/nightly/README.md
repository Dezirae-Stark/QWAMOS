- **Semgrep**: Security rule violations
- **Bandit**: Python security issues
- **ShellCheck**: Bash script security
- **Dependency Audit**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 3. Gateway Security Test Results

- I2P route validation
- DNSCrypt fallback modes
- Block-without-VPN rule enforcement

### 4. VM Isolation Test Results
- Filesystem isolation verification
- Network namespace isolation
- Cross-VM communication prevention
- Privilege escalation testing

### 5. Post-Quantum Cryptography Test Results
- Kyber-1024 key generation
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- Weak crypto fallback detection

## Viewing Reports

### Latest Report
```bash
cat reports/nightly/LATEST.md
```

### Specific Date
```bash
cat reports/nightly/security-scan-2025-11-18.md

## Workflow Schedule

The nightly security scan runs automatically:
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Trigger**: GitHub Actions cron schedule
- **Duration**: ~15-30 minutes

## Manual Execution

To run the security scan manually:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run nightly-security.yml

# With options
gh workflow run nightly-security.yml \
  -f run_full_suite=true \
  -f skip_slow_tests=false
```

Or via GitHub web interface:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Nightly Security Scan" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Artifacts

In addition to committed reports, the workflow generates artifacts:
- Static analysis reports (JSON + text)
- Gateway security test logs
- VM isolation test results
- PQC test output

Artifacts are retained for 30-90 days and can be downloaded from workflow runs.

## Integration

### CI/CD Integration
The workflow automatically:
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab (CodeQL)
- Commits reports to this directory
- Creates workflow summaries
- Generates downloadable artifacts

### Notifications
Configure GitHub Actions notifications in repository settings to receive alerts on:
- Security scan failures
- Critical vulnerabilities detected
- Test suite regressions

## Report Format

Reports are generated in Markdown format with:
- Executive summary table
- Detailed test results
- Code snippets for violations
- Remediation recommendations
- Links to detailed artifacts

## Security Standards

Tests validate compliance with:
- OWASP Top 10
- NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standards
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- QWAMOS security requirements

## Retention Policy

- **Reports**: Indefinite (committed to repository)
- **Artifacts**: 30-90 days
- **CodeQL Results**: 90 days (GitHub Security tab)
